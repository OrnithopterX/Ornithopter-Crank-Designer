# Ornithopter-Crank-Designer

{Currently a work it progress}

  Welcome to Ornithopter Crank Designer!
Designed to be like Inverse kinematics for your Ornithopter, you no longer have to input different 
Variable like Crank radii or linkage length countless times to find the best results. Rather input the performance related information and let the calculator 
find the best solution!
To get started, simply download the newest version and open the excel spreadsheet.

Everything is designed to be as easy as possible to use, without limiting advanced users.
