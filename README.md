# Ornithopter-Crank-Designer

  Welcome to Ornithopter Crank Designer!
Designed to be like Inverse kinematics for your Ornithopter, you no longer have to input different 
Variable like Crank radii or linkage length countless times to find the best results. Rather input the performance related information and let the calculator 
find the best solution!
To get started, simply download the newest version and open the excel spreadsheet.

Everything is designed to be as easy as possible to use, without limiting advanced users.

# Supported Configurations

•Staggered Crank

•"Perfect" Staggered Crank*

•Duel Crank

More to come...

*While in theory, the same as the Staggered Crank profile. Only the desired wing amplitude can be used as a input
leaving the calculator to find the best dihedral and anhedral, resulting in the lowest possible offset between the wings.
